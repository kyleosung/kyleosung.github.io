			<h2>Research</h2>
            <p>In the summer I was doing research in Data Science and Machine Learning on charging cycles of lithium batteries. The GitHub repo is private at the moment, but we are making use of the following Python datasci modules: scikit-learn, scipy, pysindy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, gpy, and more.</p>
            <p>Our techniques include SINDy, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics, to determine the differential equations given by the dynamical system of battery measurements. Now, we attempt to predict these equations using a Gaussian Process and initial states of the battery. We also attempt to use neural networks to obtain predictions based on the initial state of the system.</p>
			<p>In the future I hope to work on more datasci projects involving Deep Learning and Statistics. I also hope to explore areas of Pure Math such as Number Theory and Analysis.</p>
